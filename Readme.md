# Example of an opinionated Clean Repo

A template repository for use with most git repos with boilerplate settings already added.
Loosely based on [@deadlydog Template](https://github.com/deadlydog/Template.NewGitRepo)

Example to aid [this vscode issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/226673)

## ‚ùì Why this exists

I don't like lots of config file sprawl and would like a cleaner repo layout in future.
This would aid in config file scanning as well as if needed mass updating of all config files across multiple repositories.
